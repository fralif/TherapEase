Casptone Project Bangkit dari Tim C23-PC721

In this project we want to help people who have **mental illness** by creating an application that can help someone check their mental health level and provide recommendations for activities that should be done to improve their mental health. With this application, someone who has a mental illness can find out what activities can be done to **feel better** without having to ask other people's suggestions.
