# TherapEase
Casptone Project Bangkit dari Tim C23-PC721

In this project we want to help people who have **mental illness** by creating an application that can help someone provide recommendations for activities that should be done to improve their mental health. With this application, someone who has a mental illness can find out what activities can be done to **feel better** without having to ask other people's suggestions.
